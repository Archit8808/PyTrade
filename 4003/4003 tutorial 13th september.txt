->>>A machine can process either: 11x1 kg. per week, or 45x2 kg.,
or 30x3kg. per week. What combinations of x1, x2 and x3 can
be loaded in 8 weeks?
.... ≤ 8 or .... ≥ 8 ?


11 x1 kg / week 


x1/11 + x2/45 + x3/40 <= 8 weeks 
(kg / kg/week) = (week) 


11x1 / 11 = 1 weeks work 
22x1/11 = 2weeks work 
88x1/11 = 8 weeks work 

so if we had 88 x1 in the question , we would have loaded the required weeks work in just 
one week 

->>>Ingredient x1 must constitute at most 25% of all ingredients
X1, X2, and X3?

x1/x1+x2+x3 <= 25/100

4x1 <= x1+x2+x3 
3x1 - x2 - x3 <= 0

Hamilton’s Poutine is a delivery food business. The company
makes a net income of $1.00 for each regular poutine and $1.50 for
each deluxe poutine sold. The firm currently has 150 pounds of
potatoes and 50 pounds of topping mix. Each regular poutine uses
1 pound of potatoes and 4 ounces (note: 16 ounces = 1 pound) of
topping mix. Each deluxe poutine uses 1 pound of potatoes and 8
ounces of topping mix. Based on the past demand per week,
Hamilton’s Poutine can sell at least 50 regular poutines and at
least 25 deluxe poutines. The problem is to determine the number
of regular and deluxe poutines they should make to maximize net
income. Formulate this problem as a linear programming problem


f(x) = 1x1 + 1.5x2 

x1 -> regular poutine 
x2 -> premium poutine 

where C1 = 1 ( dollars per potuine) 
C2 = 1.5 ( dollars per premium poutine) 


Constraint 1 : 1x1 + 1x2 <= 150  
As we have 150 pounds of potatoes and each poutine just takes 1 pound
Hence C3,C4 = 1,1 
where they are pound required per poutine 


Constraint 2 : 4/16 x1 + 8x2 <= 50 
As we have 50 pounds of potatoes and each poutine just takes 1 pound = 16 ounces
C5,C6 = 4/16 , 8 as 

Constraint 3 : x1 >= 50 
	       x2 >= 25

Example 2
A company makes two products (x1 and x2), measured in kg using
two machines (A and B). Each kg of x1 that is produced requires
50 minutes processing time on machine A and 30 minutes
processing time on machine B. Each kg. of x2 that is produced
requires 24 minutes processing time on machine A and 33 minutes
processing time on machine B. At the start of the current week
there are 30 kg. of x1 and 90 kg. of x2 in stock. Available
processing time on machine A is forecast to be 40 hours and on
machine B is forecast to be 35 hours.
The demand for x1 in the current week is forecast to be 75 kg. and
for x2 is forecast to be 95 kg. Company policy is to maximize the
combined sum of the units of x1 and the units of x2 in stock at the
end of the week


Machine A :       50x1/60 + 24x2/60 <= 40 
C1 = 50/60 , C2 = 24/60    (hours)  as rhs is in hours 

Machine B : 



Stock at the end : Stock at the start of the week + production(in the week) - demand 

x1 + 30 - 75 + (x2 + 90 - 95) 

= x1 + x2 - 50 (function to be maximized)

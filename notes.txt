Discount curves : d(T) -> discount factor corrposponding to 
                            discounting back from time T 

Spot rate curves : y(T) -> Yield curve . d(T) = e^-y(T)T
                            continuosly compounded

y(T) = -log (d(T))/T
where T is the maturity period of that bond and  y(T) is the yield
